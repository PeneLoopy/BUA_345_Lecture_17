### Models we've covered so far

- Up until now in MAS 261 and BUA 345:

  - All of our regression models (SLR and MLR) have had a response, Y, that was ***QUANTITATIVE*** and ideally normal (or transformed to be normal):

    -   amount of sleep

    -   selling price

    -   natural log of insurance charges

    -   etc.
    
---

### How Logistic Regression is different

- Today we'll model responses (y variables) that are ***CATEGORICAL*** and ***BINARY***, such as

   - yes or no

   - survive or not

   - disease or no disease

- LOGISTIC REGRESSION is used when your response is BINARY (has two categories)

   - This is one type of generalization of the linear model format you've already learned.

   - There are MANY other model generalizations for other data types (not covered in BUA 345).

   - These models are called GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS (GLM):

     - We are relaxing or the assumption that the response, Y is quantitative and normal.
    
---

### Logistic Regression Models

.pull-left[

- We can't model the dichotomous (two-category) response directly using the linear model.

- Instead, we **'LINK'** our binary response to our predictor variables using a link function.

- The underlying math is interesting, but not needed for this course.

### Probability and Odds

- In order to understand logistic regression models, it is helpful to know:

  - The differences between Probability and Odds

  - How to convert Probability to Odds and vise versa

  - How to convert Log Odds to probability using `exp` OR `plogis` function

- We cover these concepts FIRST, because:

  - Log Odds, LN(ODDS), is the link (link function)

  - This function LINKS our two categorical response, Y to our predictor (X) variables:

- If we understand this link, then we can understand and interpret Logistic Regression analyses.

---

### Probability and Odds are NOT the same!

.pull-left[

-   Odds are often used incorrectly. For example:

&lt;img src="docs_files/images/Plane_Odds_Incorrect.png" width="758" /&gt;

]


.pull-right[

This news item indicates that the PROBABILITY of survival is 95.7%



**Odds of Survival `\(≠\)` Prob. of Survival = P(Survival)**

&lt;br&gt;

$$
Odds(Survival) = \frac{P(Survival)}{1-P(Survival)} = ?
$$

&lt;br&gt;

-   **Note: This question is in HW 8**

]



---


### Dice Example

.pull-left[


&lt;img src="docs_files/figure-html/dice demo-1.png" width="504" /&gt;


]

.pull-right[

&lt;br&gt;

The probability of any side of the die is 1/6:

$$P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = P(6) = 1/6 $$

&lt;br&gt;

The Odds of any side, e.g. rolling a 2 is as follows:

$$
Odds(2) = \frac{P(2)}{1-P(2)} = 
\frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1-\frac{1}{6}} = 
\frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{5}{6}} = \frac{1}{5}
$$

]

---

### Lecture 17 In-class Exercises

#### **Question 2 (L17) - Session ID: bua345s23**

The probability(p) of rolling a 3 or higher with a single die is 4/6 or 2/3, i.e., `\(P(3,4,5,6) = \frac{2}{3}\)`.

**What are the ODDS of rolling a 3 or higher?**

Hint: It is possible for odds to be greater than 1.

&lt;br&gt;

#### **Question 3 (L17)** 

If you flip a fair coin, the probability of heads = probability of tails = 1/2, i.e., `\(P(Heads) = P(Tails) = \frac{1}{2}\)`

**What are the odds of a coin landing on heads?**

---

### Odds and Betting

- Horse-racing and betting are where people commonly hear the term odds.

- For example, a horse in a race has 9 to 1 odds of winning.

- What is the probability this horse will win?

&lt;br&gt;

**How do we calculate probability from odds?**

$$
Probability = \frac{Odds}{1 + Odds}
$$

**9 to 1 odds means Odds = `\(\frac{1}{9}\)`**

$$ 
P(Win) = \frac{\frac{1}{9}}{1 + \frac{1}{9}} = 
\frac{\frac{1}{9}}{\frac{10}{9}} =
\frac{1}{10} = 0.1
$$ 

**Conclusion:** A horse with **9 to 1 odds** of winning has a **probability of 0.1 or a 10%** chance of winning the horse race.

---

### Lecture 17 In-class Exercises

#### **Question 4 (L17) - Session ID: bua345s23**

In Texas Hold'em, each player get's two face down cards in their 'pocket'. There are also three face up cards that everyone can use to make their best hand.

&lt;br&gt;

The odds of getting a 'Pocket Pair', a pair two cards of the same value in the face down cards is 16 to 1.

&lt;br&gt;

`\(Odds(Pocket Pair) = \frac{1}{16}\)`

&lt;br&gt;

**What is the probability of a pocket pair?** Round your answer to 3 decimal places

Recall:

$$
Probability = \frac{Odds}{1 + Odds}
$$

---

### Why Odds are useful to Logistic Regression

.pull-left[

- Probability is more intuitive

- Odds, and more specifically, ***LN(Odds)*** are the magic LINK between a binary response and our predictor variables.

- When we do Logistic Regression, the estimated response will be LN(Odds)

- Just like we back transform LN(Y) to get Y, we can convert LN(Odds) to probabilities.


]

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="docs_files/images/owl.png" width="304" /&gt;

]


---

### Why back-transform Log-odds

**We DON'T want to know:**

  - the estimated log odds of winning a game
  - the estimated log odds that it will rain tomorrow

**We DO want to know:**

  - the estimated PROBABILITY of winning a game
  - the estimated PROBABILITY that it will rain tomorrow

So, we can convert the estimated log odds to a probability in Excel or R:

  -   Y' = Estimated Log Odds = Estimate of `\(LN(\frac{P}{1-P})\)` from model

  -   Y' is the model estimate that we want to convert to a probability

  -   Est. Probability, `\(P = \frac{e^{Y'}}{1+e^{Y'}}\)`

  -   This can be calculated in Excel or R using the `exp` function:

  -   This conversion can be done more simply in R with the `plogis` function
  
---

### Example of Converting Log Odds

- A logistic regression model predicts the log odds that a small business owner will be audited by the IRS based on relevant predictor variables.

- Based on this model, a cafe in Syracuse determines that the estimated log odds of being audited in 2022 is -1.946, **Y' = -1.946**

&lt;br&gt;

#### Lecture 17 In-class Exercises

#### **Question 5 (L17) - Session ID: bua345s23**

If Estimated Log Odds = Y' = -1.946, what is the probability that this cafe will be audited?

Recall: Est. Probability, `\(P = \frac{e^{Y'}}{1+e^{Y'}}\)`


```r
# ln_odds &lt;- 

# using exp function (same as excel)

# using plogis function (only in R)
```

---

### Logistic Regression in R

&lt;br&gt;

The following examples will show how logistic regression uses LN(Odds) as a link function to model a two category (binary) response.

- The model estimates, LN(Odds) can be converted to probabilities

- For HWs and quizzes and the final exam you will be expected to:

  - calculate odds from probabilities.

  - calculate probabilities from odds.

  - estimate probabilities from log odds estimates from a logistic regression model.

### Titanic data

.pull-left[

More complete version of Titanic passenger data than we worked with before.

All data are CATEGORICAL:

- Response, Y, is Survived: Yes or No

- Predictors, X variables, are:

   - Class (of Passenger ticket): First, Second, Third , Crew

   - Age (Category): Adult, Child

   - Gender: Male, Female

**What is the estimated probability of survival based on gender, age category, and passenger class?**

### Verifying Data for Logistic Regression

In order to use Logistic Regression the following conditions must be met:

- Each category of each predictor variable has more than **ONE** observation in each response category

- MOST categories have more than **FIVE** observations in each response category


```r
# import and examine data
titanic &lt;- read_csv("titanic.csv", show_col_types = F) |&gt;
  glimpse()
```

```
## Rows: 2,201
## Columns: 4
## $ Class    &lt;chr&gt; "Crew", "First", "Crew", "Third", "First", "Crew", "Third", "…
## $ Age      &lt;chr&gt; "Adult", "Adult", "Adult", "Adult", "Adult", "Adult", "Adult"…
## $ Gender   &lt;chr&gt; "Male", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Ma…
## $ Survived &lt;chr&gt; "Yes", "Yes", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "Yes", "No"…
```

---

### Verifying Data for Logistic Regression

- These tables show that all categories of each predictor variable have some 'Yes' and some 'No' observations.
-   All categories are represented in both categories of response, so all predictors can be used in model.

```r
titanic |&gt; select(Survived, Class) |&gt; table()   # examine data by class category
```

```
##         Class
## Survived Crew First Second Third
##      No   673   122    167   528
##      Yes  212   203    118   178
```

```r
titanic |&gt; select(Survived, Age) |&gt; table()     # examine data by age category
```

```
##         Age
## Survived Adult Child
##      No   1438    52
##      Yes   654    57
```

```r
titanic |&gt; select(Survived, Gender) |&gt; table()  # examine data by gender
```

```
##         Gender
## Survived Female Male
##      No     126 1364
##      Yes    344  367
```

### Specifying the Logistic Regression Model:

The command we use in R, `glm` is used for Generalized Linear Models.

- For BUA 345, you are expected to interpret the coefficients from a logistic regression model.

  - Use provided code to get model estimates, LN(Odds)

  - Convert Estimated LN(Odds) to probabilities

  - In more advanced analytics courses, we will talk about model fit and validation.

**Steps Shown in Following Code**

**`1.`**  Create a `glm` model named `titanic_logistic`

- `family=binomial(link = 'logit')` specifies the model has a binary (two-category) response

**`2.`**  Output model results using `blr_regress` command from `blorr` package

- If this package doesn't work, an alternative command is `summary`

---

### R code to Specify and Summarize Titanic Model


```r
titanic &lt;- titanic|&gt; mutate(SurvivedF = factor(Survived))         # create factor variable

titanic_logistic &lt;- glm(SurvivedF ~ Class + Age + Gender, data=titanic, # specify model
                        family=binomial(link = 'logit'))

blr_regress(titanic_logistic) # examine model output
# summary(titanic_logistic)   # alternative if bls_regress doesn't work
```

- `Estimate` column shows the estimated beta coefficients for our model.

   - We will use these beta coefficients in Excel to show how regression estimates of log odds and probability are calculated for each observation (passenger) in the data.

- `Pr(&gt;|z|)` column shows the P-value for each beta coefficient.

### Add Log Odds and Probabilities to Titanic Data


```r
titanic &lt;- titanic |&gt; # create a new variable that shows log odds of survival for each passenger
  mutate(Log_Odds_Survival = titanic_logistic |&gt; glm(titanic, family = binomial) |&gt;  predict.glm() |&gt; round(4))
         
# convert log odds to probabilities using plogis command
titanic &lt;- titanic |&gt; mutate(Prob_Survival = Log_Odds_Survival |&gt; plogis() |&gt; round(4)) 

head(titanic) |&gt; kable()
```



|Class |Age   |Gender |Survived |SurvivedF | Log_Odds_Survival| Prob_Survival|
|:-----|:-----|:------|:--------|:---------|-----------------:|-------------:|
|Crew  |Adult |Male   |Yes      |Yes       |           -1.2339|        0.2255|
|First |Adult |Female |Yes      |Yes       |            2.0438|        0.8853|
|Crew  |Adult |Male   |No       |No        |           -1.2339|        0.2255|
|Third |Adult |Male   |No       |No        |           -2.1540|        0.1040|
|First |Adult |Male   |No       |No        |           -0.3762|        0.4070|
|Crew  |Adult |Male   |No       |No        |           -1.2339|        0.2255|

### Titanic Model Interpretation


We can use an Excel spreadsheet (like we did for MLR) to estimate **log odds** and **probabilities** for each category

- For example:

  - What is the probability that a Female Adult Crew member?

  - What is the probability that a Male Adult in Third Class?

  - What is the probability that a Male Child in First Class survived?

- Recall:

  - Baseline categories first alphabetically) are not shown.

  - Baseline Class: Crew

  - Baseline Age category: Adult

  - Baseline Gender = Female
  
---

### Lecture 17 In-class Exercises

#### **Question 6 (L17) - Session ID: bua345s23**

Based on the Titanic Logistic Regression Model, what is the probability that a Male Adult in Third Class survived?

Use provided worksheet to do calculation. Round answer to 3 decimal places.

&lt;br&gt;

#### **Question 7 (L17) - Session ID: bua345s23**

Based on the Titanic Logistic Regression Model, what is the probability that a Male Child in First Class survived?

Use provided worksheet to do calculation. Round answer to 3 decimal places.

---

### Two Plots for Context

-   The titanic data are commonly used because the differences between class and gender are so clear.
-   When looking at probabilities by category, it is also important to look at numbers of observations in each category.

### Late Payment Model Interpretation

We can use an Excel spreadsheet (like we did for MLR) to estimate **log odds** and **probabilities** for each category

- For example:

  - What is the probability of a late payment for a 30 year old with 1 dependent and a debt ratio of 0.3?

  - What would be the Percent Change in debt ratio if another 30 year old had 4 dependents and debt ratio of 0.5? (HW 8)

### Lecture 17 In-class Exercises

#### **Question 6 (L17) - Session ID: bua345s23**

What is the probability of a late payment for a 30 year old with 1 dependent and a debt ratio of 0.3?

Use provided worksheet to do calculation. Round answer to 3 decimal places.

&lt;br&gt;

### Now we're ready to examine HW 8 - Part 2

### Reminder Upcoming Dates

.pull-left[

- **HW 7 was due on Monday, 3/20**. 

   - Grace Period was extended until Wednesday 3/22 at midnight, because of Spring Break.
   
   - HW 7 can still be turned in today (Thu. 3/23), for only a 10% deduction 
   
- **HW 8 is due Monday, 3/27**

  - Part 1 pertains to Lectures 15 and 16 
    
  - Part 2 pertains to Lecture 17 (today's lecture)

### Key Points from Today

.bg-azure.b--dark_cyan.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph2[

- Logistic Regression is useful for predicting outcomes

  - Helpful in decision making - provides probabilities

  - Underlying math of GLM is more complex

  - Software (such as R) allows students to bypass math and focus on interpretation

- Important to understand

  - Difference between Odds and Probabilities

  - How to convert odds to probabilities and vise versa

  - How to convert log odds to probabilities (you can use `plogis` function in R)
